# IJC437-Streaming-Effect

This repository contains the coursework project for the IJC437 module.

## Project Overview
This project explores how popular music in the Billboard Hot 100 has evolved between 2000 and 2023, with a focus on the transition from the download era to the streaming era. Using Spotify audio features and lyric-based text analysis, the project examines changes in song length, lyrical structure, and emotional characteristics.

## Repository Structure

- `/figures`: Key visualisations used in the report  
- `/data`: Data source description (raw data not uploaded due to size and licensing constraints)  
- `/report`: Final written report for the IJC437 coursework

## Code Structure
